To compile and run this program, type:


gcc -o prime.c prime.o
gcc -o priority.c priority

in a terminal, press enter,

Then run it using the format

./priority [Input File Name]

again pressing enter,

[Input File Name] is the name of a text file containing information on up to ten processes, with process numbers, arrival time, cpu burst, and priority listed in the file.

Input files should be formatted as:

0       1       6       3
1       2       4       2
2       2       2       1
3       4       6       2
4       6       4       3
5       7       2       4

Where field 1 is the process number, 2 is the arrival time, 3 is the burst, and 4 is the priority of the process.

Processes must also be sorted in the input file by arrival time.

Limitations: The program requires input files use the correct format and that no more than 10 processes are used.
